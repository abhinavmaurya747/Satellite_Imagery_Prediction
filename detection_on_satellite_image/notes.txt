Please run the following command in case of a large satellite image :-
python main.py -i PATH_TO_IMAGE

In case of a small image run the command :-
python yolo_object_detection_satellite_image.py -i PATH_TO_IMAGE

the image will be imported and predictions will be run on it.

Output will be in form of two files :-
annotation - image_name.txt - it will contain all the objects along with its location in the image.
prediction - image_name.jpg - in the image where objects are present a bounding box is created over it to highlight it.
